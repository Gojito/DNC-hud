# DNC-hud

Load this lua with main job DNC. The large rose is your Flourishes3 recast. When up, the flower is bright red. 
When down it is less visible, and a small timer appears.

The smaller flower is your Flourishes2 and works the same, except it doesn't have a smaller timer.

Lastly, the FMs will be displayed in yellow. The game does not distinguish between FMs 6-9, so you will see 5+ if you have
greater than 5 FMs.


KNOWN ISSUES
If you've changed jobs, then back to main DNC, you may get an error about performing arithmetic on a nil value. 
This doesn't seem to effect the addon.
